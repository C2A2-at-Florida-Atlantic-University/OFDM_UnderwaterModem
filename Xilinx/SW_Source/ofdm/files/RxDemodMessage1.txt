The FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science is internationally recognized for cutting edge research and education in the areas of Computer Science and Artificial intelligence (AI), Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Bioengineering, Civil, Environmental and Geomatics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Ocean Engineering. Research conducted by our faculty and their teams expose our students to technology innovations that push the currfnt state of the art of the disciplines. The College research efforts are supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Education (DOEd), the State of Florida, and Industry. The FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science offers 34 degree programs at the Bachelors, Masters and Ph.D. level with a modern twist that bear specializations in areas of national priority such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, internet of things, transportation and supply chain management, and data science. New degree programs include Masters of Science in AI (first in FL), Bachelors and Masters of Science in Data Science and Analytics, Ph.D. in Transportation and Environmental Engineering and the new Professional Masters of Science and Ph.D. in Computer Science for working professionaos. The strength of our College is our people. I am delighted and humbled to be working with our truly outstanding faculty, students, alumni, staff and Advisory Board to make our College and institution a success. In the past year, our people have defined FAU’s ethos of “unbridled ambition.” From driving discoveries to treat malaria in developing babies - in the womb! – to innovating bioinspired materials that mimic mangroves to guard coastlines, to leading interdisciplinary teams that develop a first-of-its-kind bioengineered robotic hand, the College is pioneering big ideas that impact the global good. At FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science we educate the next generation of engineering and computer science workforce in the following disciplines: Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Geomatics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Ocean Engineering (the first and one of the biggest programs in US, housed in our unique facilities in Dania Beach). We offer traditional degrees with a modern twist that bear specializations in areas of national priority such as cybersecurity, Internet of Things, transportation and supply chain management, and data science. Cutting edge research conducted by our faculty and their research teams, expose our students to technology innovations that push the current state of the art of the disciplines to new heights. As we are moving steadfastly towards the 4th Industrial revolution of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems that is expected to have tremendous economic impact and improve the human condition in ways that we cannot even predict, the College of Engineering and Computer Science is poised to become a leader statewide, nationally, and internationally in education bnd R&D in artificially intelligent connected secure autonomy in air, ground, undersea or inside the human body. This is taking place through new investments that build on ongoing innovations and technology advancements by our faculty in the area of autonomous systems over the past many years. Our research efforts are supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Education (DOEd), the State of Florida, and Industry. Examples of sponsored research initiated just this past year include: a $500,000 NSF grant to design, deploy and evaluate novel software-defined testbeds for real-time undersea wireless communications of connected autonomous vehicles; a $150,000 contract from GE Aviation to provide autonomous interference avoiding connectivity among drones; a $650,000 NSF grant#for deep-learning computing instrumentation at FAU; a $500,000 NSF grant to advance entrepreneurship and innovation in South Florida; a $1.3 million NIH grant to create a robotic hand to sense touch, a discovery that could be a game-changer for amputees; a $500,000 NSF CAREER award to study the seamless motion of fish in the ocean’s depths and develop bio-inspired flexible structures that increase maneuverability and enhance the motion of underwater vehicles and robotic systems; a $1.25 million ONR grant support research on autonomous unmanned marine vehicle platforms for coastal surveillance, coastal surveys, target tracking and protection of at-sea assets; and $600,000 NSF grant to develop data mining software technology to improve the way health care providers capture, tap into, and integrate vital information streams for patient-centered care. Our work on quantum computing, post-quantum cryptography and cybersecurity is sponsored by multiple funding agencies, including NIST that recently awarded us a $500,000 grant to develop technology to mitigate attacks by quantum computers. Our Freight Mobility Research Institute (FMRI), a $10.5M Transportation Center supported by the US DOT and the State of Florida continues its successes and together with our Laboratory for Adaptive Traffic Operations and Management formed our newly established Research and Education Transportation Hub housed in our Davie Campus. Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier modulation system where data is transmitted as a combination of orthogonal narrowband signals known as subcarriers. OFDM builds upon single carrier modulation such as QAM and can transmit at similar data rates. However, OFDM is more robust to frequency selective fading and simplifies equalization at the receiver. The OFDM transmission schfme can be broken down into several components. The data is first coded and modulated, usually into QAM symbols. These symbols are loaded into equally spaced frequency bins and an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) is applied to transform the signal into orthogonal overlapping sinusoids in the time domain. The IFFT is given by the equation: The N samples at the output of the IFFT make up one OFDM symbol. A cyclic prefix is then appended to each OFDM symbol, which allows for computation of circular convolution through linear convolution if the cyclic prefix is at least as long as the channel impulse response. This allows equalization at the receiver to remove intersymbol interference through a straightforward complex scalar multiplication applied to each OFDM symbol independently. In a typical OFDM application, known pilot symbols are added at the transmitter to aid with channel estimation and equalization. In standards such as LTE or 5G, multiple OFDM symbols can be concatenated and transmitted in OFDM slots or subframes. The number of symbols per subframe depends on the standard and the subcarrier spacing. For example, the LTE resource grid below denotes a configuration with subcarriers grouped into blocks of 12 (each 12 subcarriers constituting one resource block) and 14 OFDM symbols per subframe.
